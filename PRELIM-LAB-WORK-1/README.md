Got it 👍 Here’s a clean, ready-to-use **README.md** for your Bubble Sort project, based exactly on your Python file.

# Bubble Sort (Descending Order) – Python

## 📌 Description

This project demonstrates the **Bubble Sort algorithm** implemented in **Python**, sorting a list of integers in **descending order**.
The program reads numbers from a text file, sorts them, measures execution time, and saves the sorted result to an output file.

This is useful for understanding:

* Basic sorting algorithms
* File handling in Python
* Time complexity measurement

---

## 🧠 How the Program Works

1. Reads integers from `dataset.txt`
2. Sorts the numbers using **Bubble Sort (Descending Order)**
3. Measures the time taken to sort
4. Displays the sorted result
5. Saves the output to `sorted_output.txt`

## 📂 Project Structure

```
project-folder/
│
├── bubblesort_castillo.py
├── dataset.txt
└── sorted_output.txt   (auto-generated)
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python **3.x**
* No external libraries required (uses built-in modules only)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Place `dataset.txt` in the **same folder** as `bubblesort_castillo.py`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run the program:

```bash
python bubblesort_castillo.py
```

---

## 📝 Input Format (`dataset.txt`)

* One integer per line
* Example:

```
45
12
89
3
67
```

---

## 📤 Output

* Console display:

  * Time taken
  * Total numbers sorted
  * Sorted list (descending)
* File output:

  * `sorted_output.txt` containing the sorted numbers (one per line)

---

## ⏱️ Performance Note

Bubble Sort has a time complexity of:

* **Best case:** O(n)
* **Average/Worst case:** O(n²)

⚠️ Not recommended for very large datasets, but ideal for learning purposes.
